<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a Mechanical Engineer at Qfinsoft, I collaborate with developer teams, 
project managers, and salespeople to implement application designs 
that support customer needs and technical challenges. 
I also offer product training, testing, and continuous improvement 
for cost-effectiveness and market leadership.</p> 

<p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering 
from the University of Pretoria in 2021, where I developed a passion 
for need-based mechanical design. 
I have completed multiple certifications in ANSYS, Machine Learning, 
and PID Control, which enable me to apply advanced analytical 
and computational skills to solve engineering problems 
in the safest and most efficient ways. 
I am a goal-driven individual who works well individually and in teams.</p>
